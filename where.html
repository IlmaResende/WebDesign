            <h3><b>Hotels</b> are, typically, located in central regions, offer private bathrooms, room service and
                breakfast.
                Mainly because they are in privileged areas of cities, such as in the center or in neighborhoods with
                strong tourist or economic activity, hotels are ideal for those traveling on business, or in groups who
                wish to visit tourist attractions or spend their time sightseeing. There are hotel chains for all tastes
                and budgets.

        <section class="hostel">
            <img src="img/Hostel.png">
            <h3><b>Hostel</b> is the most common alternative among young people. It is a popular type of accommodation
                among
                those who have a limited budget to travel. It's cheaper because guests often share bedrooms, bathrooms
                and kitchens with other travelers. This modality is also a good option for those who travel alone and
                want to make friends and have contact with other cultures, as it is common for people from different
                countries to stay there.
            </h3>
        </section>
        <section class="resort">
            <img src="img/Resort.jpeg">
            <h3><b>Resorts</b>, unlike hotels or hostels, offer a complete experience for the guest.
                The idea is that travelers do not need to leave the resort's premises to have fun, eat and rest.
                Establishments of this model usually offer all-inclusive packages, that is, all services, even meals,
                are included in the daily price. Because resorts normally have supervision for children, they are the
                best option for families who want to have fun and also have relaxing moments.
